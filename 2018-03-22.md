# Ayria meeting 2018-03-22

## Present
@Siilwyn  
@Convery  

## Agenda
- How to share the first 'alpha' version?
- What do we want out of the first release in terms of feedback?
- Do we want a website for Ayria & the desktop app?
- Has the piping been tested from Node?
- Should there be a command line tool?

## Notes
- The main reason to get the release out is so developers can start using it.
- Creating plugins using other languages like Rust is possible but requires a template.
- Focus on plugin creation and usage first before looking into a way to share.
- The domain ayria.se has been recovered.
- Promotional content ready for alpha, third party developing a plugin as well.
- Piping data from the client to plugins is useful for setting user data like an username.

## Actions
- @Siilwyn: package app as an executable ([#72](https://github.com/AyriaPublic/desktop/issues/72))
- @Convery: ask around and create some basic plugins that can be used as reference.
- @Siilwyn: create website about Ayria with general structure for documentation. Something like [GitHub's desktop app page](https://desktop.github.com/).
- @Convery: write documentation for the website, especially a clear path for developers to get started with plugins.
