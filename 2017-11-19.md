## Agenda
- Discuss `ayria-plugin` manifest
    - Format: JSON, YAML or TOML
    - Content: name, description, version, games, etc.
- Discuss how plugins communicate with the Ayria client
    - Pipes on windows create a new console window
    - Have the client write to Platformwrapper::Ayriacache SQLite DB
- Discuss how plugins get submitted and audited
    - Submission page to create manifest from public info
    - Putting builds on public gitlab
    - Auditing code before signing and compiling
- Discuss possible merger with Gamemodding.org
    - General site for all things modding, forum, wiki, etc.
    - Ayria as the project managing the client / plugins
- Discuss promotional content
    - Release as standalone "just using Ayria" early
    - Release with 1.0 of Ayria

## Notes
- Piping interface for communication between client and platformwrapper.
- Platformwrapper database acts as a cache of send data from the client and is shared to all plugins.
- Every plugin is submitted through a website, checked by us, when all is good the plugin is put up as a repository on our GitLab instance. For us the flow looks like this: clone source to GitLab -> audit -> compile & sign -> ship.
- JSON is very strict making it hard to edit but easy to parse, TOMLs representation of an object array is verbose and looks weird, YAML could be a good choice.
- Prefer putting everything under the Ayria name, could link from gamemodding.org subdomain to ayria.se.
- Forum could use https://www.discourse.org/.
- Client refactoring can be put into three steps:
    1. project code structure: logic-view bindings, possibly use of framework;
    2. error handling: show unhandled errors in the UI and handle common errors;
    3. plugin validation: validate plugin manifest on installation.

## Actions
- @Convery and @Siilwyn: create a (dummy) named pipe in C++ and try to wire it up with Node.
- @Siilwyn: look into plugin manifest: how YAML is parsed, specifically the difference between data types: when is something an integer?
- @Convery: investigate the status of the domain ayria.se, can it migrated by confirming ownership with DNS?
- @Siilwyn: refactor client project structure.
- @Siilwyn: plan a meeting with @mrsoft and possibly @00jd to talk about how they can contribute.
