# Ayria meeting 2017-03-27

## Present
@Siilwyn  
@Convery  
@nta  

## Agenda
- Status and inner workings of plugins 'registry'.
- Link between plugins and games?

## Notes
- Work on the plugins registry/scraper is paused, first priority is getting manual locall plugin installation working.
Talking through how it will work in the future. First plugins will be collected from GitHub by looking for repositories with a `/ayria-plugin.json` file then the source code will be compiled and scanned. The compiled version will be uploaded as a torrent, the magnet link is then added to the JSON. Finally this JSON will be stored in a PouchDB database.
- For now plugin data will have 'game tags' like: `['steam:123', 'LIMBO']`. Where `123` is the Steam app ID.

## Actions
- @Convery: research plugin compiling and verification process.
- @Siilwyn: get manual local installation of plugins working.
